# Mini_Piano_Using_Arduino

In this tutorial, Let's see how to make a mini piano using Arduino Nano. 

## Requirements

### Hardware

* Arduino Nano
* Piezo Buzzer or Speaker
* Push button x 7
* Jumper cables

### Software

*   Arduino IDE
*   Arduino Tone Library

## Connections

The Button are connected to D4 to D10 pins of Arduino Nano
Piezo Buzzer is connected to D11 pin of Arduino Nano

| Button / Buzzer            |  Arduino Nano  |
|-----------------------|---------------|
| Button 1 |  D4 |
| Button 2 |  D5 |
| Button 3 |  D6 |
| Button 4 |  D7 |
| Button 5 |  D8 |
| Button 6 |  D9 |
| Button 7 |  D10 |
| Buzzer |  D11 |

## The Code

Before you can start playing your piano, you will need to obtain and install the Tone Arduino library if it is not already installed. 
then paste the code from the ppt

## Play Time!

And thats it! You should now be able to tap on the keys and hear the corresponding notes played through the buzzer.
